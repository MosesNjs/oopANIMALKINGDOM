# oopANIMALKINGDOM

This code is a simple classification of the kingdom Animalia using object oriented programming in javascript. 

Kingdom Animalia is divided into 6; Arthropoda, Aves, Mammal, Reptile, Amphibian and Fish. Classes were made for each one and objects we're instantiated from each of them.

A base class was created for kingdom Animalia to house the attributes common to all the sub classes, 2 classes inherited from the parent class with one attribute each and finally the 6 classes inherited from those two and each one has attributes specific to them.

This model of Kingdom Animalia was prepared while adhering to the 4 main principles of OOP; Abstraction, encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Within the code, I left comments showing my use of each principle.
